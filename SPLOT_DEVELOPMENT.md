# splot() Development Documentation

## Overview

`splot()` is a base R graphics network visualization function, designed as an alternative to `soplot()` which uses grid graphics. The goal is to replicate qgraph-style visualizations with better performance and familiar parameter names.

## Philosophy

### Why Base R Graphics?

1. **Performance**: Base R graphics (`polygon()`, `lines()`, `xspline()`, `symbols()`) are faster than grid grobs for large networks
2. **Familiarity**: Parameters mirror qgraph conventions (e.g., `vsize`, `edge.color`, `curve`)
3. **Simplicity**: Direct coordinate system without NPC unit conversions
4. **xspline()**: Produces smoother, more natural curves than grid's bezier curves

### Design Decisions

1. **Curve Direction for Reciprocal Edges**: When two nodes have edges in both directions (A→B and B→A), they curve in opposite directions forming an "ellipse" shape - one curves inward, one curves outward. This prevents overlap and matches qgraph behavior.

2. **Default Behavior** (`curves=TRUE`): Only reciprocal edges are curved; single edges remain straight. This is the most common use case for network visualization.

3. **Curve Modes**:
   - `curves=FALSE`: All edges straight
   - `curves=TRUE` or `"mutual"`: Only reciprocal edges curved (default)
   - `curves="force"`: All edges curved

4. **Inward Curve Logic**: For single edges with `curves="force"`, the curve should bend toward the network center. This is determined by:
   - Calculate network center (mean of all node positions)
   - For each edge, use cross product to determine which side of the edge the center is on
   - Adjust curve sign to bend toward center

### Curve Logic

```r
# In splot.R - determine curve signs for reciprocal edges
if (is_reciprocal[i]) {
  # Opposite directions: lower index gets positive curve
  curves_vec[i] <- if (edges$from[i] < edges$to[i]) 0.2 else -0.2
}

# In splot-edges.R - render_edges_base()
# Positive curve = bend toward center (inward)
# Negative curve = bend away from center (outward)
if (curve_i > 0) {
  # Calculate cross product to determine which side center is on
  cross <- dx * to_center_y - dy * to_center_x
  if (cross > 0) {
    curve_i <- abs(curve_i)   # Bend left toward center
  } else {
    curve_i <- -abs(curve_i)  # Bend right toward center
  }
}
```

## What Needs To Be Done

### 1. ~~HIGH PRIORITY: Inward Curve Direction Fix~~ DONE

**Problem**: When `curves="force"` is used, single (non-reciprocal) edges should curve inward toward the network center. Previously, the direction was inconsistent.

**Solution**: The issue was that `render_edges_splot()` in `splot.R` was not applying the inward curve logic that existed in `render_edges_base()`. Fixed by adding the same logic to `render_edges_splot()`:
1. Calculate network center as mean of all node positions
2. For each edge with positive curve value, use cross product to determine which side of the edge the center is on
3. Adjust curve sign: positive (bend left) if center is to the left, negative (bend right) if center is to the right
4. Negative curves (reciprocal edges curving outward) keep their original sign

### 2. ~~HIGH PRIORITY: Resolution/DPI~~ DONE

**Problem**: Output resolution needs to be higher for publication quality.

**Solution**: Added `res` parameter to control DPI for raster outputs (PNG, JPEG, TIFF). Default is now 600 DPI for publication-quality output. The parameter is passed to `grDevices::png()`, `grDevices::jpeg()`, and `grDevices::tiff()` functions.

### 3. ~~MEDIUM PRIORITY: Edge Label Positioning~~ DONE

**Problem**: Edge labels on curved edges were positioned directly on the curve, causing overlap with the edge line.

**Solution**: Added perpendicular offset to `get_edge_label_position()` in `splot-edges.R`. Labels are now offset away from the edge line:
- For curved edges: offset in the direction of the curve bulge (convex side)
- For straight edges: offset perpendicular to the edge
- Default offset of 0.03 user coordinates provides good separation

### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY: Legend Support

Add legend for:
- Node colors (groups)
- Edge colors (positive/negative weights)
- Node sizes

### 5. LOW PRIORITY: Performance Optimization

For very large networks (>500 nodes), consider:
- Batch drawing of similar elements
- Reducing xspline resolution for distant edges
- Level-of-detail rendering

```

Quick test:
```r
mat <- matrix(c(0, 0.8, 0.5, 0), 2, 2, byrow=TRUE)
rownames(mat) <- colnames(mat) <- c("A", "B")
splot(mat, layout="circle", curve=0.3)
```
